For comparison, here's the same model implemented in other frameworks: [PyTorch version](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/mnist/main.py), [TensorFlow version](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist.py). In this notebook, we'll walk through **creating and training the model**, using **config files**, registering **custom functions** and **wrapping models** defined in PyTorch, TensorFlow and MXNet. This tutorial is aimed at beginners, but it assumes basic knowledge of machine learning concepts and terminology."

But you can also define your model using a **machine learning library of your choice** and wrap it as a Thinc model. This gives your layers a unified interface so you can easily mix and match them, and also lets you take advantage of the config system and type hints. Thinc currently ships with built-in wrappers for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) and [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org/)."
