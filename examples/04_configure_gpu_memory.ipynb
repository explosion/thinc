    "# Using a single memory pool for Cupy and PyTorch or TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "Requesting memory from a GPU device directly is expensive, so most deep learning libraries will over-allocate, and maintain an internal pool of memory they will keep a hold of, instead of returning it back to the device. This means the libraries don't by default play well together: they all expect to be the single consumer of the GPU memory, so they hog it selfishly. If you use two frameworks together, you can get unexpected out-of-memory errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinc's internal models use cupy for GPU operations, and cupy offers a nice solution for this problem. You can provide cupy with a custom memory allocation function, which allows us to route cupy's memory requests via another library. This avoids the memory problem when you use PyTorch and cupy together, or when you use cupy and Tensorflow together. We don't yet have a similar solution for using PyTorch and Tensorflow together, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, we call the `require_gpu()` function, which tells Thinc and PyTorch to allocate on GPU."
