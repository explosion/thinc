    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Wrapping the tokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to keep track of the data that's passed around (and get type errors if something goes wrong), we first create a `TokensPlus` dataclass that holds the information we need from the `transformers` tokenizer. The most important work we'll do in this class is to build an _alignment map_. The transformer models are trained on input sequences that over-segment the sentence, so that they can work on smaller vocabularies. These over-segmentations are generally called \"word pieces\". The transformer will return a tensor with one vector per wordpiece. We need to map that to a tensor with one vector per POS-tagged token. We'll pass those token representations into a feed-forward network to predict the tag probabilities. During the backward pass, we'll then need to invert this mapping, so that we can calculate the gradients with respect to the wordpieces given the gradients with respect to the tokens. To keep things relatively simple, we'll store the alignment as a list of arrays, with each array mapping one token to one wordpiece vector (its first one). To make this work, we'll need to run the tokenizer with `is_split_into_words=True`, which should ensure that we get at least one wordpiece per token."
