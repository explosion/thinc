# Thinc: Practical Machine Learning for NLP in Python

**Thinc** is the machine learning library powering [spaCy](https://spacy.io). It
features a battle-tested linear model designed for large sparse learning
problems, and a flexible neural network model under development for
[spaCy v2.0](https://spacy.io/usage/v2).

Thinc is a practical toolkit for implementing models that follow the
["Embed, encode, attend, predict"](https://explosion.ai/blog/deep-learning-formula-nlp)
architecture. It's designed to be easy to install, efficient for CPU usage and
optimised for NLP and deep learning with text â€“ in particular, hierarchically
structured input and variable-length sequences.

## Development status

Thinc's deep learning functionality is still under active development: APIs are
unstable, and we're not yet ready to provide usage support. However, if you're
already quite familiar with neural networks, there's a lot here you might find
interesting. Thinc's conceptual model is quite different from TensorFlow's.
Thinc also implements some novel features, such as a small DSL for concisely
wiring up models, embedding tables that support pre-computation and the hashing
trick, dynamic batch sizes, a concatenation-based approach to variable-length
sequences, and support for model averaging for the Adam solver (which performs
very well).

## No computational graph â€“ just higher order functions

The central problem for a neural network implementation is this: during the
forward pass, you compute results that will later be useful during the backward
pass. How do you keep track of this arbitrary state, while making sure that
layers can be cleanly composed?

Most libraries solve this problem by having you declare the forward
computations, which are then compiled into a graph somewhere behind the scenes.
Thinc doesn't have a "computational graph". Instead, we just use the stack,
because we put the state from the forward pass into callbacks.

All nodes in the network have a simple signature:

```
f(inputs) -> {outputs, f(d_outputs)->d_inputs}
```

To make this less abstract, here's a ReLu activation, following this signature:

```python
def relu(inputs):
    mask = inputs > 0
    def backprop_relu(d_outputs, optimizer):
        return d_outputs * mask
    return inputs * mask, backprop_relu
```

When you call the `relu` function, you get back an output variable, and a
callback. This lets you calculate a gradient using the output, and then pass it
into the callback to perform the backward pass.

This signature makes it easy to build a complex network out of smaller pieces,
using arbitrary higher-order functions you can write yourself. To make this
clearer, we need a function for a weights layer. Usually this will be
implemented as a class â€” but let's continue using closures, to keep things
concise, and to keep the simplicity of the interface explicit.

The main complication for the weights layer is that we now have a side-effect to
manage: we would like to update the weights. There are a few ways to handle
this. In Thinc we currently pass a callable into the backward pass. (I'm not
convinced this is best.)

```python
import numpy

def create_linear_layer(n_out, n_in):
    W = numpy.zeros((n_out, n_in))
    b = numpy.zeros((n_out, 1))

    def forward(X):
        Y = W @ X + b
        def backward(dY, optimizer):
            dX = W.T @ dY
            dW = numpy.einsum('ik,jk->ij', dY, X)
            db = dY.sum(axis=0)

            optimizer(W, dW)
            optimizer(b, db)

            return dX
        return Y, backward
    return forward
```

If we call `Wb = create_linear_layer(5, 4)`, the variable `Wb` will be the
`forward()` function, implemented inside the body of `create_linear_layer()`.
The `Wb` instance will have access to the `W` and `b` variable defined in its
outer scope. If we invoke `create_linear_layer()` again, we get a new instance,
with its own internal state.

The `Wb` instance and the `relu` function have exactly the same signature. This
makes it easy to write higher order functions to compose them. The most obvious
thing to do is chain them together:

```python
def chain(*layers):
    def forward(X):
        backprops = []
        Y = X
        for layer in layers:
            Y, backprop = layer(Y)
            backprops.append(backprop)
        def backward(dY, optimizer):
            for backprop in reversed(backprops):
                dY = backprop(dY, optimizer)
            return dY
        return Y, backward
    return forward
```

We could now chain our linear layer together with the `relu` activation, to
create a simple feed-forward network:

```python
Wb1 = create_linear_layer(10, 5)
Wb2 = create_linear_layer(3, 10)

model = chain(Wb1, relu, Wb2)

X = numpy.random.uniform(size=(5, 4))

y, bp_y = model(X)

dY = y - truth
dX = bp_y(dY, optimizer)
```

This conceptual model makes Thinc very flexible. The trade-off is that Thinc is
less convenient and efficient at workloads that fit exactly into what
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) etc. are designed for. If your graph
really is static, and your inputs are homogenous in size and shape,
[Keras](https://keras.io/) will likely be faster and simpler. But if you want to
pass normal Python objects through your network, or handle sequences and
recursions of arbitrary length or complexity, you might find Thinc's design a
better fit for your problem.

## Quickstart

Thinc should install cleanly with both [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/thinc)
and [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/thinc), for **Pythons 2.7+ and
3.5+**, on **Linux**, **macOS / OSX** and **Windows**. Its only system
dependency is a compiler tool-chain (e.g. `build-essential`) and the Python
development headers (e.g. `python-dev`).

```bash
pip install thinc
```

For GPU support, we're grateful to use the work of Chainer's `cupy` module,
which provides a numpy-compatible interface for GPU arrays. However, installing
Chainer when no GPU is available currently causes an error. We therefore do not
list Chainer as an explicit dependency â€” so building Thinc for GPU requires some
extra steps:

```bash
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-8.0 # Or wherever your CUDA is
export PATH=$PATH:$CUDA_HOME/bin
pip install chainer
python -c "import cupy; assert cupy" # Check it installed
pip install thinc_gpu_ops thinc # Or `thinc[cuda]`
python -c "import thinc_gpu_ops" # Check the GPU ops were built
```

The rest of this section describes how to build Thinc from source. If you have
[Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org) installed, you can use the shortcut:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/explosion/thinc
cd thinc
fab clean env make test
```

You can then run the examples as follows:

```bash
fab eg.mnist
fab eg.basic_tagger
fab eg.cnn_tagger
```

Otherwise, you can build and test explicitly with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/explosion/thinc
cd thinc

virtualenv .env
source .env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
py.test thinc/
```

And then run the examples as follows:

```bash
python examples/mnist.py
python examples/basic_tagger.py
python examples/cnn_tagger.py
```

## Usage

The Neural Network API is still subject to change, even within minor versions.
You can get a feel for the current API by checking out the examples. Here are a
few quick highlights.

### 1. Shape inference

Models can be created with some dimensions unspecified. Missing dimensions are
inferred when pre-trained weights are loaded or when training begins. This
eliminates a common source of programmer error:

```python
# Invalid network â€” shape mismatch
model = chain(ReLu(512, 748), ReLu(512, 784), Softmax(10))

# Leave the dimensions unspecified, and you can't be wrong.
model = chain(ReLu(512), ReLu(512), Softmax())
```

### 2. Operator overloading

The `Model.define_operators()` classmethod allows you to bind arbitrary binary
functions to Python operators, for use in any `Model` instance. The method can
(and should) be used as a context-manager, so that the overloading is limited to
the immediate block. This allows concise and expressive model definition:

```python
with Model.define_operators({'>>': chain}):
    model = ReLu(512) >> ReLu(512) >> Softmax()
```

The overloading is cleaned up at the end of the block. A fairly arbitrary zoo of
functions are currently implemented. Some of the most useful:

-   `chain(model1, model2)`: Compose two models `f(x)` and `g(x)` into a single
    model computing `g(f(x))`.
-   `clone(model1, int)`: Create `n` copies of a model, each with distinct
    weights, and chain them together.
-   `concatenate(model1, model2)`: Given two models with output dimensions
    `(n,)` and `(m,)`, construct a model with output dimensions `(m+n,)`.
-   `add(model1, model2)`: `add(f(x), g(x)) = f(x)+g(x)`
-   `make_tuple(model1, model2)`: Construct tuples of the outputs of two models,
    at the batch level. The backward pass expects to receive a tuple of
    gradients, which are routed through the appropriate model, and summed.

Putting these things together, here's the sort of tagging model that Thinc is
designed to make easy.

```python
with Model.define_operators({'>>': chain, '**': clone, '|': concatenate}):
    model = (
        add_eol_markers('EOL')
        >> flatten
        >> memoize(
            CharLSTM(char_width)
            | (normalize >> str2int >> Embed(word_width)))
        >> expand_window(nW=2)
        >> BatchNorm(ReLu(hidden_width)) ** 3
        >> Softmax()
    )
```

Not all of these pieces are implemented yet, but hopefully this shows where
we're going. The `memoize` function will be particularly important: in any batch
of text, the common words will be very common. It's therefore important to
evaluate models such as the `CharLSTM` once per word type per minibatch, rather
than once per token.

### 3. Callback-based backpropagation

Most neural network libraries use a computational graph abstraction. This takes
the execution away from you, so that gradients can be computed automatically.
Thinc follows a style more like the `autograd` library, but with larger
operations. Usage is as follows:

```python
def explicit_sgd_update(X, y):
    sgd = lambda weights, gradient: weights - gradient * 0.001
    yh, finish_update = model.begin_update(X, drop=0.2)
    finish_update(y-yh, sgd)
```

Separating the backpropagation into three parts like this has many advantages.
The interface to all models is completely uniform â€” there is no distinction
between the top-level model you use as a predictor and the internal models for
the layers. We also make concurrency simple, by making the `begin_update()` step
a pure function, and separating the accumulation of the gradient from the action
of the optimizer.

### 4. Class annotations

To keep the class hierarchy shallow, Thinc uses class decorators to reuse code
for layer definitions. Specifically, the following decorators are available:

-   `describe.attributes()`: Allows attributes to be specified by keyword
    argument. Used especially for dimensions and parameters.
-   `describe.on_init()`: Allows callbacks to be specified, which will be called
    at the end of the `__init__.py`.
-   `describe.on_data()`: Allows callbacks to be specified, which will be called
    on `Model.begin_training()`.
