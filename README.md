# Thinc: A refreshing functional take on deep learning, compatible with your favorite libraries

### From the makers of [spaCy](https://spacy.io), [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)

[Thinc](https://thinc.ai) is a **lightweight deep learning library** that offers an elegant,
type-checked, functional-programming API for **composing models**, with support
for layers defined in other frameworks such as **PyTorch, TensorFlow and MXNet**. You
can use Thinc as an interface layer, a standalone toolkit or a flexible way to
develop new models. Previous versions of Thinc have been running quietly in
production in thousands of companies, via both [spaCy](https://spacy.io) and
[Prodigy](https://prodi.gy). We wrote the new version to let users **compose,
configure and deploy custom models** built with their favorite framework.

- Wrap **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow** and **MXNet** models for use in your network.
- Concise **functional-programming** approach to model definition, using composition rather than inheritance.
- Optional custom infix notation via **operator overloading**.
- Integrated **config system** to describe trees of objects and hyperparameters.
- Choice of **extensible backends**.

## üöÄ Quickstart

Thinc is compatible with **Python 3.6+** and runs on **Linux**,
**macOS** and **Windows**. The latest releases with binary wheels are available from
[pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/thinc). Before you install Thinc and its
dependencies, make sure that your `pip`, `setuptools` and `wheel` are up to
date. For the most recent releases, pip 19.3 or newer is recommended.

```bash
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install thinc
```

See the [extended installation docs](https://thinc.ai/docs/install#extended) for details on optional dependencies for different backends and GPU. You might also want to [set up static type checking](https://thinc.ai/docs/install#type-checking) to take advantage of Thinc's type system.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you have installed PyTorch and you are using Python 3.7+, uninstall the
> package `dataclasses` with `pip uninstall dataclasses`, since it may have
> been installed by PyTorch and is incompatible with Python 3.7+.

## üêç Development notes

Thinc uses [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) for auto-formatting, [`flake8`](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting and [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for type checking. All code is written compatible with **Python 3.6+**, with type hints wherever possible. See the [type reference](https://thinc.ai/docs/api-types) for more details on Thinc's custom types.

### üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Building Thinc from source

Building Thinc from source requires the full dependencies listed in
[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) to be installed. You'll also need a
compiler to build the C extensions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/explosion/thinc
cd thinc
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --no-build-isolation .
```

Alternatively, install in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .
```

Or by setting `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

### üö¶ Running tests

Thinc comes with an [extensive test suite](thinc/tests). The following should all pass and not report any warnings or errors:

```bash
python -m pytest thinc    # test suite
python -m mypy thinc      # type checks
python -m flake8 thinc    # linting
```

To view test coverage, you can run `python -m pytest thinc --cov=thinc`. We aim for a 100% test coverage. This doesn't mean that we meticulously write tests for every single line ‚Äì we ignore blocks that are not relevant or difficult to test and make sure that the tests execute all code paths.
